# Functional_Programming_Java_Submission_Task

Simple simulation of a webbshop for shoes,
the customer can login to create a order and buy shoes.
This program is made to communicates with a seperate Database.

The program does not take access levels into account,
to more easily present all functions.
The program has several visible but unavailable funtions,
that is not implemented as it was not requested in the task.

This is a Submission task for a functional programming course.
The project is combined with a database course based on MySQL.
